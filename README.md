**Overview:**

This repository contains the source code for an educational tool designed to assist students in learning about algorithms and data structures, with a focus on linked lists. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for practicing and testing knowledge related to linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

**Features:**

**Linked List Visualization:** A graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and interacting with linked lists, making it easier for students to grasp the concept.

**Problem Generation:** The system allows instructors to generate a variety of linked list-related problems, along with their solutions, to help students practice and learn.

**Algorithm Testing:** Students can test their understanding of various linked list algorithms and operations, such as insertion, deletion, and more.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The tool offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that students can use for self-study and practice.
